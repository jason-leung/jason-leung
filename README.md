I am a biomedical engineer with an interest in biosignal processing, neurotechnology, and software development. One of the projects I'm most proud of is developing brain-computer interfaces for children with disabilities. I find it incredibly satisfying to be able to use technology to help those living with disabilities.

I am a detail-oriented individual who enjoys taking on challenging problems. I like to explore novel approaches in solving problems using my skills in biomedical engineering. I love bouncing ideas off of my peers and talking about the latest technologies, so please reach out if you feel the same!
